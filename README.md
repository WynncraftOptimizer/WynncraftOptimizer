not sure if you will nead to import threading, but might need to look into that.

i am using the sequential version of the code, but at the bottom of the main file is also my tries to implement a parallel version,
which worked for an earlier version, but was slower.

I recommend using the sliders, because i am not 100% sure the typing in the number fields work.
